    <h4>Zoos are places where wild animals are kept for public display. The word “zoo” is short for “zoological park.” Zoos contain wide varieties of animals that are native to all parts of the Earth.It is not known when the earliest zoos were established, but it is possible that they were associated with the first attempts at animal domestication. Pigeons were kept in captivity as early as 4500 BCE in what is now Iraq, and 2,000 years later elephants were semidomesticated in India. Antelopes, including the addax, ibex, oryx, and gazelle, are depicted wearing collars on Egyptian tomb pictures at Ṣaqqārah, dating from 2500 BCE. In China the empress Tanki, who probably lived about 1150 BCE, built a great marble “house of deer,” and Wen Wang, who apparently reigned just before 1000 BCE, established a zoo of 1,500 acres in extent, which he named the Ling-Yu, or Garden of Intelligence.Zoos are places where wild animals are kept for public display. Zoos are often the sites of sophisticated breeding centers, where endangered species may be protected and studied. Some zoos, like this aquarium in Monterey, California, are dedicated to one species or set of species. (Aquariums are dedicated to the display of aquatic creatures.)</h4></div>
